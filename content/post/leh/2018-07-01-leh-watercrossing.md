It was day 12 of our Bangalore to Ladakh trip when we encountered this amazing water
crossing, between Pang and Manali. There have been so many water crossings throughout the journey in the himalayas.
But, this was the best of them all

We spent almost an hour there, but boy, was it fun!!

I'm not writing anything more, watch the video for yourself. Try to watch it fully ;)
