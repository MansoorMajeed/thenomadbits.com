In this post, I will be discussing about the riding gears, luggage carriers, other
accessories etc. Hope this will be helpful to someone

## Luggage Carriers

If you are going for a long ride, you're gonna have to carry your things. Your clothes
mostly. There are different ways you can carry your things. Tank bags, saddle bags, normal
bags etc.

### Saddle bag

Saddle bags are great. They offer a lot of storage and they are a must if you are
traveling long distance.

These are two of my favorite bags

#### 1. Viaterra Claw

Product Link : [Viaterra Claw](https://viaterragear.com/shop/luggage/viaterra-claw-2017-motorcycle-tail-bag/)

This is the bag I use. If you are riding without a pillion, choose this blindly. It costs
around 3400 INR.

##### Pros

- Super stable, even at 150 Km/h (don't ride at 150kmph on Indian roads. Seriously)
- Comes with a rain cover
- Plenty of storage (60L)
- Very good material
- No need of additional bungee cords
- No need of luggage frames
- Won't go anywhere near the silencer (it depends on the bike though. It fits fine on CBR250R)

##### Cons

- A bit difficult to mount (I'm nitpicking here)
- Cannot be used with a pillion
- There is a chance that the bottom of the bag will get dirty during rain

##### Notes

The rain cover could come off at high speed on windy roads. So, make sure you use the velcro
provided in the rain cover to close it up properly on the bag. You don't really need to use any additional bungee
cord with the bag, but I used it anyway just for the peace of mind (I used the bungee over the
rain cover)

Make sure that you arrange your things evenly and properly on the bag or it would look
weird on the bike. It might even hang onto one side. But it doesn't cause any problems,
just that it looks really bad.

#### 2. Rynox Nomad

If you are riding with a pillion, this is another good option. The material is of high quality
and offers ample storage. You have to be careful when you mount it, if it gets loose, the bag
could touch the exhaust. If you mount it properly, it won't happen

### Tank Bag

Tank bags are not an absolute necessity, but very handy. You can keep your things that you might
use often. Phone, charger, sunglass, whatever. If you are going for a weekend trip, you can keep
your clothes too.

#### Magnetic Tank bag

Magnetic tank bags are the best. I use the [Rynox Optimus M](https://www.rynoxgears.com/products/optimus-m-tank-bag)
You can remove the bag from the tank just by lifting it up. And is super stable even at 150km/h.
The bag comes with a rain cover, and the bag can withstand small rain without the rain cover.

> Note: The magnetic tank bag can only be used on bikes with metal tank (stating the obvious)

#### Non magnetic tank bag

If your bike has a non-metallic tank, you can use the

### Mobile phone mount and charger

This is something every rider should have. There are mobile phone mounts in different
price ranges. It's up to you on which one to choose. I use the original
[RAM Mount](https://www.amazon.in/Ram-U-Bolt-Mount-Universal-X-Grip/dp/B006X387ZS), which is a
little bit expensive, but very very durable. Highly recommend this one.

I use a generic bike charger (costed me some 700 rupees), which is connected to one of the brake light
wire and so the charger gets turned on only with ignition, and is connected through a fuse. Make sure you do it like that.

## Riding gears

The importance of riding gears cannot be emphasized more. So many people don't really
give it much of thought, until they get into any accident. In our trip, there were many incidents
where the riding gears saved our day.

### 1. A good helmet

You cannot put a price on your head. Spend some money and get a good helmet. This
is the most important gear of all. Try to get a helmet that is DOT/ECE certified. You can get a
decent helmet for starting 5000 rupees. MT, LS2 etc are good brands for entry level helmets

### 2. Riding Jacket

Armored riding jackets are a must. They have padding on shoulders, arms and back.
These are the impact points and they help a lot in case of a fall. (Witnessed how helpful they are firsthand - stories coming up)
Invest some money, go to a bike shop and get a good armored jacket. [Rynox](https://www.rynoxgears.com/collections/jacket) has
jackets starting at 6000 rupees.

### 3. Riding gloves

Leather gloves with knuckle and palm protection. They come in different price
ranges. Try to get a leather one.

If you plan to ride to very cold places (less than 10 degree celsius), a weatherproof riding
glove is very handy. They will be very useful in rain too.
Normal riding gloves won't be much of help in cold conditions.

### 4. Knee guard

This is one of those things that could save a day very easily. I have seen a lot of people
riding with all the gears except the knee guard. But, think about this, if you fall from your
bike, the first and the most common part that will kiss the tarmac is your knee.

There are different kinds of knee protection you can have. Some of them will be hard plastic
that you wear on top of your jeans. Some of them will have more cushion and can be worn inside
the pants.

I use this one from [Mototech](https://www.amazon.in/MOTOTECH-Bulwark-Bionic-Knee-Armour/dp/B00VA7LSQ2)
and provides very good protection for your knee and shin.

One thing I don't like about this knee guard is that, if you ride a fully faired bike,
the bolts on the inner side of the knee guard could scratch the fairing. Take a look
at what part of your knee touches the fairing and see if the fairing could get scratched.

### 5. Riding pants

Riding pants offers better protection and comfort than having a knee guard over your normal
pants. But for me, I could not find a riding pants that fits me properly. If you could
find one that fits you well, I'd strongly advise you to get one.

## Accessories

Here are a few things that I found to be very useful

### Earplugs

People don't pay attention to this. If you travel above 100km/h on a motorcycle,
you should be using earplugs. The wind noise can and will damage your ear *permanently*
if it gets exposed to such high noise for long periods of time. 

I have an article [HERE](https://traversal.in/motorcycle/health/why-earplugs-while-riding-motorcycle.html) about why you should be using an earplug


That is it for the time being. I will update if I come across anything else useful
